"""Unit tests for HeadlessSession's timeout/kill mechanics -- turn_timeout,
session_timeout, and _fail's process-termination path. No real `claude`
CLI or Anthropic API calls: a plain `cat` subprocess stands in for the
real one, so these run fast and free as part of the normal test suite.

mcp_config/allowed_tools/cwd/model are all irrelevant to what's under test
here (only __enter__ uses them, and __enter__ is bypassed entirely by
_stub_session below), so dummy values stand in for them.
